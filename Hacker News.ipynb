    "# Optimising social media post interaction - Hacker News\n",
    "Hacker News is a user-submission site similar to reddit where posts can be voted and commented on.\n",
    "\n",
    "|Index|Variable name | Description|\n",
    "|:---|---|---:|\n",
    "|`0`|`id` | unique identifier for post|\n",
    "|`1`|`title`|title of post|\n",
    "|`2`|`url`|url link for post|\n",
    "|`3`|`num_points`|number of points aquired by post|\n",
    "|`4`|`num_comments`| number of comments on the post|\n",
    "|`5`|`author`|username of person who submitted the post|\n",
    "|`6`|`created_at`|date and time post was posted (Eastern Standard Time -5 hours)|\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment is particularly interest in posts with `Ask HN` and `Show HN` as a tag to determine some insight.\n",
    "\n",
    "## More about the data:\n",
    "The data comes from the following link on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is obtained using a scraper on Hacker News and has data on posts for the previous year (up until 26th September 2016).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals of the project:\n",
    "I want to find someone insight into what kind of posts has the most interaction form users of the social media site, Hacker News.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a proxy of interaction I will use two different variables: number of comments and number of points.\n",
    "\n",
    "My main conclusion I reached using this dataset is that on average \"Ask\" posts generate more comments than \"Show\" posts. \n",
    "\n",
    "For \"Ask\" posts, the optimal time to post would be around 3pm as this generates on average the most comments and points.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation\n",
    "I think I could have fared better if I had implemented functions rather than typing the code out in full. \n",
    "\n",
    "It would have been better in terms of memory management as well due to writing the code out seperate lead to many redundant variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code I used for each post type was reusable and would have been less complex than doing each one seperately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing I would have changed is disaggregated the other posts further as both ask and show posts only consist of around 15% of the dataset."

    "\n",
    "The second best option would be to post at 8pm as same logic as above applies, the subsequent hour period (9pm) also has a fairly high chance of receiving a comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For show posts, the posts that received the most comments on average are the posts which are posted in the hour after 6pm. However there seems to be no pattern between the hour the post is posted and the average number of comment received. For show posts, posting during the hour after 6pm or at 12am tend to on average net the most amounts of comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "For other posts, the hours from 11-3pm is the best times to receive the most amounts of comments. The difference in averages from the hours after 1pm, 12pm, 11pm and 3pm do not vary by much. Even the hour after 2pm only on average receiving 2 extra posts compared to the rest of the top 5. \n",

    "For show posts, it seems to be better to post around 11pm/12am. Previously we showed that the averages for comments on show posts was very close for 6pm and 12am. Now however the difference posting at 12am seems to net a larger amount of likes (this difference is negligible) compared to 6pm. It seems to be optimal to post at 12am to gain the most amounts of like.\n",
    "\n",
    "For other posts, it exhibited the same pattern as the top 5 comment by hour. The differences amongst the top 5 is very small (a maximum of 2 likes). However previously, we showed that it is optimal to post between 11am-3pm as it on average obtains the most comments. However this data shows a more narrow window of posting between 1pm-3pm to optimise the number of likes."
